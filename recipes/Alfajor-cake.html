    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Alfajor cake is made with layers of shortbread-like cookies and <em>dulce de leche cream</em>- simply delicious. </p>
    <p>It will take approximately<strong> 3 hours and 15 minutes</strong> for the dish to be completed</p>
    <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li> ⅓ cup white sugar</li>
        <li> 2 large eggs</li>
        <li> 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
        <li> ½ cup cornstarch</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li> ½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li> ½ cup whole milk</li>
        <li> 1 (13.4 ounce) can dulce de leche</li>
        <li> ½ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li> ¼ cup powdered sugar, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>STEPS</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><ul><li>Beat butter with a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment on medium speed until creamy, about 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add sugar and beat until light and fluffy, scraping down the sides of bowl as needed, about 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating until incorporated after each addition, about 30 seconds.</li></ul></li>
        <li><ul><li>Whisk together flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl until combined.</li>
                <li>Add flour mixture to butter mixture in 3 additions, alternating alternately with the milk,</li>
                <li>starting and ending with the flour mixture, and beat until combined after each addition.</li></ul></li>
        <li><ul><li>Turn dough out onto a floured work surface and turn to coat dough. Knead dough 2 or 3 times.</li>
                <li>Divide dough into 5 equal pieces and shape each piece into a ball.</li>
                <li>Working with 1 ball at a time, roll dough into a 7-inch circle.</li>
                <li>Place dough circles on 2 large rimmed baking sheets lined with parchment paper (I fit 3 circles on 1 sheet and 2 on the other).</li>
                <li>Chill dough circles, uncovered, for 1 hour.</li></ul></li>
        <li><ul><li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Prick each dough circle lightly with a fork.</li></ul></li>
        <li><ul><li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned on bottom and light browned around the edges, 15 to 18 minutes.</li>
                <li>(If baking in 2 batches, keep second batch refrigerated while first batch bakes.)</li>
                <li>Cool cake layers completely on a wire rack, about 30 minutes.</li></ul></li>
        <li><ul><li>Spoon dulce de leche into a medium bowl.</li>
                <li>Beat cream with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form, about 6 minutes.</li>
                <li>Gently stir half of cream mixture into dulce de leche until combined.</li>
                <li>Gently fold remaining cream into dulce de leche mixture until combined.</li></ul></li>
        <li><ul><li>Spread 1/3 cup of the dulce de leche mixture onto 1 cake layer, spreading to edges.</li>
                <li>Place onto a serving platter with dulce de leche mixture facing up.</li>
                <li>Repeat process with the next 3 cake layers (this is easier to spread on cake layers before placing on platter).</li>
                <li>Spread remaining 2/3 cup dulce de leche mixture onto fifth cake layer and place on top.</li>
                <li>Let stand 1 hour. Dust top of cake with powdered sugar and serve.</li>
                <li>Cover any leftovers with plastic wrap and store in refrigerator up to 1 day.</li></ul></li>
    </ol>
